      <description>*Written following week 12
Intro Goals are the currency of football, and it&amp;rsquo;s no secret that Sheffield United have severly lacked in this category. With 5 goals through twelve matches, the Blades are a far-cry from where they sat last year at this time. After 12 matches in the previous season, Sheffield United sat in a European position with 13 goals in their account. So why has the club parted ways with their elite company and found themselves at the bottom of the table?</description>

      <description>Simon Fisher I am a data scientist focused on conducting analysis to inform data driven decision making. I am particularly interest in applying mathematical and econometric analysis to understand various problems and inefficiencies in the football industry. I have experience working with multiple MLS clubs.
Most recently, I worked with Nashville S.C. as a Technical Performance Data &amp;amp; Recruitment Analyst during their inaugural season that saw them progress to the MLS Conference semi-final.</description>

      <description>Tracking Data Visualizations  Marking Map THREAD:
Been away from Twitter for a bit. Here is one of the things that I&amp;#39;ve been working on...
Using anonymized data, I implemented @lastrowview idea for marking maps https://t.co/Qs0tzNVSR0
In particular, I adapted this routine to evaluate the goal seq below. Observations: pic.twitter.com/Gis4YHl7KQ
